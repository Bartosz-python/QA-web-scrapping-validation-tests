# 📚 QA Automation Book Scraper (Playwright + Pytest)

A **QA Automation portfolio project** built with **Playwright** and **Pytest**.  
This project scrapes book data from the demo website [Books to Scrape](https://books.toscrape.com/), validates the data, and saves the results in **Excel** and **HTML reports**.

The goal is to showcase:
- **Web scraping** with Playwright
- **Test automation** with Pytest
- **Data validation & reporting** with pandas
- **Modern Python (3.13)** practices
- **CI/CD readiness** with GitHub Actions

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Headless Browser Scraping** with Playwright  
- ✅ **Data Validation** (title, price, rating checks)  
- ✅ **Excel Reporting** using pandas  
- ✅ **HTML Reports** with pytest-html  
- ✅ **Pytest Markers** (`smoke`, `validation`, `regression`)  
- ✅ **Parallel Execution** with pytest-xdist  
- ✅ **CI/CD Ready** (workflow can be added to run on GitHub Actions)

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bartosz-python/QA-web-scrapping-validation-tests.git
cd qa-book-scraper
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install
```

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
pytest
```

Run only smoke tests:
```bash
pytest -m smoke
```

Run in parallel for faster execution:
```bash
pytest -n auto
```

After each run, reports are generated in:
- **`outputs/`** → Excel test results  
- **`reports/`** → HTML test report
